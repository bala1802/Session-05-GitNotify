# GitNotify with verification

## Overview

Designed and implemented a Model Context Protocol Server to manage and automate GitHub-related activities. The server processes user queries to clone repositories, pull the latest changes, and send email notifications upon completion. To enhance the verification process, I utilized AppleScript to monitor GitHub activity, ensuring accurate tracking and validation of repository actions.


## Features
	•	GitHub Integration: Clone repositories and pull the latest changes.
	•	Email Notifications: Send and verify email notifications using the Gmail API.
	•	Task Automation: Utilize FastMCP for orchestrating multi-step processes.
	•	Reasoning Display: Log step-by-step reasoning for debugging and traceability.

## File Structure
1. `email_activities_helper.py`
Handles Gmail API authentication and email-related functionalities:
	•	`authenticate()`: Authenticates the Gmail API service.
	•	`send_email()`: Sends an email to a specified recipient.
	•	`was_email_sent()`: Verifies if an email was sent within the last minute.
2. `git_activities_helper.py`
Provides Git log retrieval functionality:
	•	`get_git_log()`: Fetches the Git log for a specified branch.
3. `gmail_mcp_server.py`
The main server script that integrates MCP tools to perform tasks:
	•	Tools implemented:
	•	`clone_repo(repo_url)`: Clones a GitHub repository.
	•	`pull_repo(repo_dir)`: Pulls the latest changes from a repository.
	•	`send_email(message)`: Sends an email notification.
	•	`verify(result)`: Verifies the result of an action.
	•	`show_reasoning(steps)`: Displays reasoning steps.
4. `prompts.py`
Contains predefined prompts for interacting with the MCP server.
5. `talk2GmailMCP.py`
Client script that interacts with the MCP server and processes user queries:
	•	Establishes connection to the MCP server.
	•	Handles tool execution based on LLM responses.
	•	Automates tasks such as cloning repositories, pulling changes, and sending emails.
Requirements
Python Libraries
	•	`google-auth` (for Gmail API authentication)
	•	`google-api-python-client` (for Gmail API interactions)
	•	`gitpython` (for Git operations)
	•	`dotenv` (for environment variable management)
	•	`FastMCP` (for task orchestration)
	•	`google-generativeai` (for LLM-based interactions)

Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=<Your Generative AI Key>
RECEIVER_EMAIL_ID=<Recipient Email Address>
```

Setup Instructions
	
    1.	Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

    2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    3. Set up environment variables in `.env`.

    4. Authenticate Gmail API:
    •	Run the authentication script (`auth.py`) to generate a valid token (`token.json`).

Usage

Starting the Server
Run the MCP server using:
```
python gmail_mcp_server.py dev
```

Interacting with Server via Client

Use the client script to execute tasks:

```
python talk2GmailMCP.py
```

Example Workflow
	1.	Clone a GitHub repository.
	2.	Pull changes from the repository.
	3.	Send an email notification about updates.

<img width="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85924f05-08cd-410c-ab58-a23be06f6d86" />


Example Output

1. Cloning Repository:
```
Repository cloned into /path/to/repository
```

2. Pulling Changes:
```
Repository updated with the latest changes.
```

3. Sending Email:
```
✅ Email sent successfully to recipient@example.com! Message ID: abc123xyz456
```

4. Verification:
✅✅✅✅✅✅✅ Verification Passed ✅✅✅✅✅✅✅

Notes
•	Ensure valid Gmail API credentials are available in `token.json`.
•	The project is designed for debugging and traceability, making it suitable for development environments.

12-04-2025, 07-49-19 - [SUCCESS] Retrieved 5 tools.
12-04-2025, 07-49-19 - [INFO] Processed tool: 1. show_reasoning(steps: array) - 
    Displays the step-by-step reasoning process used in a given task.

    This tool prints each step in the reasoning chain to the console, helping developers or
    users understand how decisions were made or how a sequence of operations unfolded.

    Args:
        steps (list): A list of reasoning steps as strings, where each entry represents
                      one step in the decision-making or execution process.

    Returns:
        str: A confirmation message indicating the reasoning steps were displayed.

    Behavior:
        - Iterates over the list of reasoning steps.
        - Logs each step to the console in a numbered format for better readability.

    Example:
        >>> show_reasoning([
                "Started cloning the repository.",
                "Verified repository folder exists.",
                "Pull the code changes from the repository.",
                "Verified the latest pull status.",
                "Email notification sent.",
                Verified whether Email sent successfully or not.
            ])
        # Output:
        # ----------- Step 1 - Started cloning the repository. ------------
        # ----------- Step 2 - Verified repository folder exists. ------------
        # ----------- Step 3 - Pull the code changes from the repository. ------------
        # ----------- Step 4 - Verified the latest pull status. ------------
        # ----------- Step 5 - Email notification sent. ------------
        # ----------- Step 6 - Verified whether Email sent successfully or not. ------------

    Notes:
        - This tool is primarily for debugging and traceability.
        - Output is written to the console; it is not returned in the response text.
    
12-04-2025, 07-49-19 - [INFO] Processed tool: 2. clone_repo(repo_url: string) - 
    Clones a GitHub repository to a specified directory.
    
    Args:
        repo_url (str): The URL of the GitHub repository to clone.
    
    Returns:
        str: The directory path where the repository is cloned.
    
12-04-2025, 07-49-19 - [INFO] Processed tool: 3. pull_repo(repo_dir: string) - 
    Pulls the latest changes from the specified repository.
    
    Args:
        repo_dir (str): The local directory path of the repository.
    
    Returns:
        str: "Changed" if new updates were pulled, "NoChanges" if the repository is up-to-date.
    
12-04-2025, 07-49-19 - [INFO] Processed tool: 4. send_email(message: string) - 
    Sends an email with the given message to a configured recipient.

    This function authenticates the email service and, if successful, 
    sends an email using the `email_activities_helper` module.

    Parameters:
    message (str): The content of the email to be sent.

    Returns:
    str: A response indicating success or failure.
    
    Errors:
    - Prints an error message and returns 'Authentication Failed' if authentication fails.
    
    Environment Variables:
    - RECEIVER_EMAIL_ID: The recipient's email address, retrieved from the environment.
    
12-04-2025, 07-49-19 - [INFO] Processed tool: 5. verify(result: string) - 
    Verifies the outcome of a previously executed MCP tool action by evaluating the 
    result string and checking the corresponding system or service state.

    Based on the type of result provided (e.g., a file path, a git operation status, or
    an email confirmation), this method determines whether the intended action was 
    successfully completed.

    Args:
        result (str): A string representing the output of a previous MCP tool.
                      - If it's a file path, it's assumed to be the result of a `clone_repo` call.
                      - If it's "Changed" or "NoChanges", it's from `pull_repo`.
                      - If it contains "Email sent successfully", it's from `send_email`.

    Returns:
        str: "Verification Passed" if the corresponding state confirms success;
             otherwise, "Verification Failed".

    Verification Logic:
        - **Repository Clone**: If the result is a valid directory path, checks whether 
          the directory exists on disk.
        
        - **Repository Pull**: If the result is "Changed" or "NoChanges", confirms by 
          inspecting the latest git log using `git_activities_helper.get_git_log()`.

        - **Email Sent**: If the result contains "Email sent successfully", verifies the email
          was sent by checking the sent items via `email_activities_helper.was_email_sent()`.

    Notes:
        - Assumes use of `is_probable_path()` to determine if a result is a valid path.
        - Depends on helper modules for git log checks and email verification.
        - The subject line used for email verification is hardcoded as:
          "Message from GMail MCP Server".
